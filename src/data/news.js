    title: 'Washington State Casinos Help Drug Gangs Launder Money',
    text: "Two members of a violent drug-trafficking ring — accused of laundering more than $1 million of meth, heroin, and fentanyl profits through Washington State casinos — were sent to prison this week by a federal judge. In a US District Court in Seattle, Jose Arrondondo-Valdez, 27, aka “Primo,” received a nine-year sentence on drug trafficking charges. Yvette Olguin, 40, was given 30 months in prison for money laundering conspiracy. Arrondondo-Valdez and Olguin are, respectively, the cousin and spouse of the alleged ringleader of the group, Cesar Valdez-Sanudo. He was sentenced to 15 years in January for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime. Arrondondo-Valdez was Valdez-Sanudo's right-hand man, according to prosecutors. The pair were arrested together at the Snoqualmie Casino, east of Seattle, where they planned to confront a gang member who owed a drug debt. Investigators found three loaded guns, one equipped with a homemade silencer, inside their vehicle.",

      'Casino giant MGM expects $100 million hit from hack that led to data breach',
    text: 'Oct 5 (Reuters) - MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) said on Thursday a cyberattack last month that disrupted its operations would cause a $100 million hit to its third-quarter results, as it works to restore its systems. One of the worlds largest gambling firms, MGM shut down its systems after detecting the attack to contain damage, it said. It expects to also incur less than $10 million as a related one-time cost in the quarter ended on Sept. 30. After the attack last month, customers posted social media images showing slot machines with error messages and queues at hotels in Las Vegas. A hacking group named AlphV claimed it was involved in the breach. Sources earlier told Reuters AlphV worked with another outfit named Scattered Spider to break into MGM systems and steal data to hold for extortion. MGM has declined to comment on whether it was asked for or paid any ransom. The private data of customers who used MGM services before March 2019, including contact information, gender, date of birth and drivers license numbers, was breached, the company said. We also believe a more limited number of Social Security numbers and passport numbers were obtained, it said. We have no evidence that the criminal actors have used this data to commit identity theft or account fraud. Hackers often hold stolen data for ransom and may also leak it to public forums or sell it to other cybercriminals. The MGM data breach, which the FBI is investigating, is a vivid example of how large organizations remain vulnerable to cybercrime. Analysts who have tracked Scattered Spider say more and more organizations have been falling for the groups skilled social engineering schemes. MGM said the hackers did not obtain any customer bank account numbers or payment card information, and that no data from its luxury resort hotel The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was breached. The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue has not been determined, MGM said in a regulatory filing. The company expects the breach will have a negative impact of about $100 million to its adjusted property core profit for its Las Vegas Strip division, and expects total occupancy of 93% this October versus 94% in the same month a year ago. Virtually all of the Companys guest-facing systems have been restored, it said, adding that it expects no impact on its full-year results from the breach. MGM said it is well-positioned to have a strong fourth quarter with record results in November, driven mainly by a Formula One racing event slated to take place in Las Vegas.',

    title: 'Single Winning Ticket Sold for $1.76 Billion Powerball Jackpot',
    text: 'One of the largest Powerball jackpots ever has been won, the lottery group said Wednesday night. At $1.765 billion, it was the second-largest jackpot ever in the United States. The winning numbers were: 22, 24, 40, 52, 64 and the Powerball 10. Huge jackpots have become increasingly common in the multistate Mega Millions and Powerball lottery drawings, because of changes to the games over the years and higher ticket prices. Between the two lotteries, nine jackpots in the United States have reached $1 billion or more since 2016, including four this year. This summer, two separate tickets won billion-dollar jackpots: In California, on July 19, when a Powerball ticket won $1.08 billion, and then in Florida, on Aug. 9, when a single ticket won a Mega Millions jackpot of $1.58 billion.',

    title: 'Gamblers in Deadwood, South Dakota Bet $140M in September',
    text: 'Last month was a busy period for casinos in Deadwood, South Dakota, a newly released report from the state’s Department of Revenue reveals. The report unveils details regarding the total handle and win reported by licensed operators offering slot games, sports betting and table games. The total gaming handle reported in September was $140.1 million, representing a 4.64% decrease when compared to the corresponding period in 2022. On the other hand, calendar year-to-date results through this September show a total gaming handle of nearly $1.2 billion. This result, when compared to the corresponding period in 2022 marks an increase of 2.63%. According to the recent report, the total statistical win reported by licensed gambling operators last month was $13.6 million. Excluding deductions, the taxable adjusted gross revenue posted by operators this September was $12,927,083.47. Considering that South Dakota taxes gambling activities at 9%, this means that the state benefitted from $1,163,437 in taxes last month. Earlier this year, Hard Rock International confirmed the opening of its Rocksino in Deadwood. The new gaming and entertainment location offers a bar, restaurant, as well as 86 slot machines. Moreover, the Rocksino by Hard Rock further expanded the offering available for Deadwood visitors.',

    title: 'Why Is Gambling Addictive?',
    text: 'Gambling is an activity that produces dopamine, regardless of the outcome. There is something bizarre about human nature and how we can be stimulated by the prospect of a theoretical return while we stake out tangible assets and are willing to take on more risk despite the small likelihood of a successful return. Gambling is addictive precisely because it works on a chemical level. Our brains are flooded with the feel-good hormone – dopamine – which in turn makes it harder to reason. Or put another way, we can reason that what we are doing is probably not entirely right, but our own body fires the wrong signals, making it harder to resist. Dopamine is the same chemical that is released in our brains when we eat our favorite foods or have sex. These two activities, even when not consumed in moderation, tend to be less harmful than gambling, which can quickly cost you a lot. The good news is that science has pinpointed the exact reason why gambling is addictive. Studies have indicated that the dopamine flood in our brains during gambling sessions is not unlike what people who use drugs get, although with gambling the sensation and “high” are more tamed, naturally. The scientific evidence is there that this dopamine-fueled biological idiosyncrasy of the human body is what makes gambling potentially addictive. But interestingly, gambling is also treacherous in other ways – it can be misleading, and it’s designed to be that way.',
